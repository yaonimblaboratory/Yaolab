## 🚀 100% Online Deployment (No Software Needed)

If you don't want to download any software to your computer, follow these steps to publish your site:

### 1. Create the Repo
1. Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/new). Do not add a README or License yet.

### 2. Open the Web Editor (The "Magic" Key)
1. On your empty repository page, press the `.` (period) key on your keyboard.
2. This opens **github.dev**, a full code editor in your browser.

### 3. Upload the Files
1. Drag and drop all the files and folders I provided into the left-hand sidebar of the editor.
2. **Important:** Ensure you include the `.github` folder (you might need to create it manually in the editor sidebar if dragging fails for hidden folders).

### 4. Save/Commit
1. Click the **Source Control icon** (3rd icon down on the far-left sidebar).
2. Type "Initial site upload" in the box.
3. Click the **Checkmark** (Commit & Push) at the top of that sidebar.

### 5. Activate the Website
1. Go back to your repository on `github.com`.
2. Click **Settings** (top bar).
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar).
4. Under **Build and deployment > Source**, change it to **GitHub Actions**.
5. Your site will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/` in about 2 minutes!

## 📝 How to Edit Content
Once live, you can update your site anytime:
1. Go to `lib/content.ts` in your GitHub repo.
2. Click the **Pencil icon** to edit.
3. Change the text, click **Commit changes**. 
4. The website will update itself automatically.
