This is the 'public' folder.

1. Save your images (e.g., my-photo.jpg) and videos inside this folder.
2. In 'lib/content.ts', refer to them simply by their filename.

Example in lib/content.ts:
  image: "my-photo.jpg"

Do not use "public/my-photo.jpg" or "/my-photo.jpg" in the code if possible, 
though the MediaDisplay component handles those cases too. 
Just "my-photo.jpg" is safest.
